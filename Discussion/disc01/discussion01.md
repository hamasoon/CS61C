## Pre-Check

#### 1.1 Depending on the context, the same sets of bits may represent different things.

    True
    'A' is 65 in ASCII, but 65 is 65 in binary.

#### 1.2 It is possible to get an overflow error in Two’s Complement when adding numbers of opposite signs.

    No

#### 1.3 If you interpret a N bit Two’s complement number as an unsigned number, negative numbers would be smaller than positive numbers.

    No
    Negative Number always has the highest bit set to 1, which makes it larger than positive numbers.

#### 1.4 If you interpret an N bit Bias notation number as an unsigned number (assume there are negative numbers for the given bias), negative numbers would be smaller than positive numbers.
